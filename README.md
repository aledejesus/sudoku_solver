# Sudoku Solver

The purpose of this leisure project is to build a web app that lets users input a sudoku puzzle and receive as output the solved puzzle and a step by step guide of how the system solved said puzzle. Mainly, this will be done by implementing widely known sudoku solving algorithms in the backend and by creating different input methods in the frontend. Roughly speaking, these project has 3 phases*:

 - _**Phase 1:**_ implement algorithms to solve test sudoku puzzles of difficulties ranging from easy to hard.
 - _**Phase 2:**_ develop different methods to input a puzzle (GUI, picture, .txt file) in the system and receive the solved puzzle as output or an error message in case that the inputted puzzle is unsolvable.
 - _**Phase 3:**_ show the user step by step how the system solved the puzzle (which methods were used, how and in what order).

*More details about each phase will be added in future commits.

## How to run?

Clone repository, install python packages specified in requirements.txt and run `python manage.py run` to start the app. Website should be available from http://localhost:8000.
